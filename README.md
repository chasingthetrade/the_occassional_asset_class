_We consider the use of commodity indexes as part of an asset allocation universe. We examine this question from both a risk-contribution and risk-premium perspective. Our [assumed] conclusion is that the cyclical nature of commodity prices makes related indices only occasionally relevant to the asset allocation process._ 

_In an [addendum] or [follow-up paper] we present a toy model of suppy/demand curves using agent-based modelling which can explain this cyclical nature._

Risk contribution: Risk-Parity style - calculate weight of commod index in w_ecr, the equal-contribution-to-risk portfolio, over time and measure consistency.  Also check commod weight in cov matrix top eigenvectors. (sign invariant)

Risk prem: Also calculate risk premium by subtracting a) avg w_ecr weighted return, b) risk-free rate and/or c) Stochastic Discount Factor.  Measure consistency.

PERHAPS USE NORMALIZED RANK ORDER FOR ABOVE STATS

Plot time vs weights/ranks

Plot scatter graph, X=w_ecr weight, Y=risk_premium, different color for each asset. Should show "regions of value"

Use basic assets for compariison univ: US eq, bonds, Eu eq, bond, EEM eq and bonds, gold, REIT

> [!NOTE]
> [exotic: commod index as a set of real options on each underlying, pricing related to "best of N" derivatives, making option greeks and implied vol relevant to value in the asset universe. Could be applied for any index though, perhaps too much of a departure]



## Two Approaches to Answer our Question:

1. lite: hist data only. Looking for consistent trend, inflation adjusted, or at least common meaningful prescense in top 5-6 eignevectors of Cov matrix
2. econ prof level: hist data plus "reasoning" supply/demand changes - - requires production data (unknown source right now)

3. What constitutes an Asset Class?

> [!NOTE]
>    []Real Assets are claims (long a call option) on productive processes. Processes are intrinsically renewable (or repeatable?), their inputs may  be. consumed, or not.
> 
> Mediums of exchange are not  obviously assets in this sense but storing them or using them as a part of a process can elevate them to being a "iReal Asset", like a bond.  If the medium is sufficiently fungible (uniform?), can be identified (brand value?)  then a store of it can be useful to lend out to people who need it - as credit or even just charging people a convenience fee to store it. Maybe we confuse the inputs with the process too much?]

4. a BIG question. Answer is smaller than you think
5. enables us to bring in BTC as a test
6.  much wider audience
