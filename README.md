_We consider the use of commodity indexes as part of an asset allocation universe. We examine this question from both a risk-contribution and risk-premium perspective. Our [assumed] conclusion is that the cyclical nature of commodity prices makes related indices only occasionally relevant to the asset allocation process._ 

_In an [addendum] or [follow-up paper] we present a toy model of suppy/demand curves using agent-based modelling which can explain this cyclical nature._

Risk contribution: Risk-Parity style - calculate weight of commod index in w_ecr, the equal-contribution-to-risk portfolio, over time and measure consistency.  Also check commod weight in cov matrix top eigenvectors. (sign invariant)

Risk prem: Also calculate risk premium by subtracting a) avg w_ecr weighted return, b) risk-free rate and/or c) Stochastic Discount Factor.  Measure consistency.

PERHAPS USE NORMALIZED RANK ORDER FOR ABOVE STATS

Plot time vs weights/ranks

Plot scatter graph, X=w_ecr weight, Y=risk_premium, different color for each asset. Should show "regions of value"

Use basic assets for compariison univ: US eq, bonds, Eu eq, bond, EEM eq and bonds, gold, REIT

> [exotic: commod index as a set of real options on each underlying, pricing related to "best of N" derivatives, making option greeks and implied vol relevant to value in the asset universe. Could be applied for any index though, perhaps too much of a departure]



## Two Approaches to Answer our Question:

1. lite: hist data only. Looking for consistent trend, inflation adjusted, or at least common meaningful prescense in top 5-6 eignevectors of Cov matrix
2. econ prof level: hist data plus "reasoning" supply/demand changes - - requires production data (unknown source right now)

If the medium is sufficiently fungible (uniform?), can be identified (brand value?)  then a store of it can be useful to lend out to people who need it - as credit or even just charging people a convenience fee to store it. Maybe we confuse the inputs with the process too much?]

> What the asset *yields* might be reflective of the value of the underlying process. PE ratios on pure management quality , without diversified customer bases are generally weak. Diversified meaning customers who would not find it trivial to substitute your product with another. Famers, miners and business with only one customer are supplying to other businesses like that. The PE ration can be used to create a hierarchy of earnings quality, perhaps reflective of this?

> When playing against a superior opponent - like a miner or farmer might be trying to supply a sophistcated conglomerate - the outcome maximzing techique is to play for the least worst out come. What does a miner or farmer do in this circumstance? Capacity utilization should be high, labor and variable expenses low (is there a known analytic factor that captures these? There is an accounting metric). Leverage should only be used to build capacity utilization?

Do commodities benefit (as pricing power) from one of these growth types or do they benefit from a counter cycle in one of these growth types? Can these growth types be extracted from analytic factors and then modeled as pro- and counter- to see?

4. a BIG question. Answer is smaller than you think
5. enables us to bring in BTC as a test
6.  much wider audience
